    "# 9.1 Camera calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebooks we have learnt how 3D points are projected to image pixels through the *camera model*, using **a series of parameters** that does not depend on the position of the 3D points, but on the camera itself, such as the focal length $f$, the principal point coordinates $(u_0,v_0)$ or the position of the camera with respect to the `WORLD` reference system. These parameters are categorized in two sets: \n",
    "- **intrinsic (or internal)**, and\n",
    "- **extrinsic (or external)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first category includes the parameters that are **constant for the same camera** (unless we are using a camera that can change its zoom), while the latter only **depends on the position and orientation of the camera** in the world. In the complete projective equation, they are placed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda \\begin{bmatrix} u \\\\ v\\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} f k_x & 0 & u_0  \\\\ 0 & f k_y & v_0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}}_{\\text{intrinsic}} \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} \\bf{R} & \\bf{t}\\end{bmatrix}}_{\\text{extrinsic}} \\begin{bmatrix} X_W \\\\ Y_W\\\\ Z_W \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\bf{\\lambda \\tilde{m}' = K \\left[ R\\ t \\right] \\tilde{M}_W}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of estimating the intrinsic and/or the extrinsic parameters of a vision system is called **camera calibration**. And that is what we are going to accomplish in this notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "The **intrinsic parameters** deal with the camera's internal characteristics, and includes:\n",
    "- its focal length ($f$), \n",
    "- the skew ($k_x, k_y$) parameters, \n",
    "- and the image center, a.k.a the coordinates of the principal point ($u_0, v_0$). \n",
    "\n",
    "In turn, the **extrinsic parameters** describe:\n",
    "- its position ($\\mathbf{t}$) \n",
    "- and its orientation ($\\mathbf{R}$) in the `WORLD` reference system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from this, there is a process we have not talked about yet in the previous notebooks, but which is of capital importance when dealing with generating images: **lens distortion**. We will address this topic in here too.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in summary, in this notebook we are going to learn about:\n",
    "- lens distortion,\n",
    "- a general procedure for calibration,\n",
    "- the Direct linear transformation (DLT) calibration method,\n",
    "- and the Zhang's method for calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem contex - Removing the lens distortion\n",
    "\n",
    "All cameras have **radial distortion** because using real lens. In the mathematical derivation we presented in the previous notebook, we assumed that no distortion was affecting the image formation procedure and hence the light coming from a certain 3D point travelled **following a straight line**, passing through the optical center and eventually hitting the sensor plane. We could say that the lens in our model was **ideal**. In real life, though, the light gets distorted when passing through the lens and **changes its direction** before reaching to the sensor. This produces distortion in the captured image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this distortion is sometimes desired (mostly for aesthetic reasons) but sometimes we need to compensate it in order to get a proper image. A typical example of high radial distortion is present in **action cameras** or **fish-eye cameras**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/intro.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the image, **straight lines in the world are not straight in the image** due to the distortion. And such distortion is more severe in the pixels further away from the center of the image (hence the term **radial** distortion).\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the distortion degree is given by a pair of variables, which should also be included in the category of intrinsic parameters. The calibration process also has the aim of determining the value of such parameters so that we can eliminate the distortion, even if it is considerably severe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will compute all the intrinsic parameters of your smartphone's camera, including the distortion ones, and use them to get a proper undistorted picture."

    "## 9.1.1 Lens distortion\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by formally stating the model of the distortion. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All the cameras distort the image to some extent, including our smartphone's camera, but, obviously, fish-eye cameras and sport cameras have a bigger **radial distortion** because their lens are more convex. The use of more convex lenses is justified in these cases as they have a **wider field-of-view** and, therefore, they can capture a bigger part of the scene. Moreover, the smaller the focal length of camera, the bigger the lens distortion it will suffer!\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, we can define the camera distortion by this formula (this is called the *even-order polynomial model*):$\\\\[10px]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}u_u & = & (1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + \\ldots)(u_d-u_0) \\qquad (u_d, v_d) \\; \\; \\text{distorted pixels}\\\\ v_u & = & (1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + \\ldots)(v_d-v_0) \\qquad (u_u, v_u) \\; \\; \\text{undistorted pixels}\\end{eqnarray}\\\\[25px]$$ $$\\text{with}\\; r^2 = (u_d-u_0)^2+(v_d-v_0)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the $r$ value stands for the **distance of the pixel to the center of the image**. In this model, the distortion degree is given by the distortion parameters ($k_1,\\ k_2, \\ldots$), creating a **non-linear expression of the distortion**, which depending on the sign of $k_1$ can produce two distorted shapes, namely **pincushion and barrel**.$\\\\[10px]$\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/radial.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, straight lines curve in the image due to the distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists another type of distortion called **tangential**, but it appears manily due to small **manufacturing defects leading to the lens and the camera sensor not being parallel**. As it is not directly related to the physical properties of lenses, we will not address this kind in this notebook, we will only mention it:$\\\\[10px]$\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/tangential.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the idea for removing the radial distortion is to **compute the distortion parameters through camera calibration** and, then, having the distorted pixels $(u_d,v_d)$, and the calibration output $(u_0,v_0)$ and $(k_1, k_2, \\ldots)$, we can find a solution for the undistorted pixels $(u_u,\\ v_u)$!\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an alternative to the **polynomial model** presented above called the **division model**, which is preferred because it requires fewer terms than the polynomial model in case of severe distortion. It is also slightly easier to work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_u = u_0 + \\frac{u_d - u_0}{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + \\ldots } \\qquad v_u = v_0 + \\frac{v_d - v_0}{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + \\ldots }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that the **number of distortion parameters should be more than only two**, but in general the parameters related to higher orders of the radial distance are small enough to not induce a strong impact in the process of removing distortion, unless we are working in applications that need extremely precise undistorted images."

But first, as explained above, we need a **calibration pattern** with the picture of the checkerboard. In the classroom it will be provided to you but you can always print [one](https://www.google.com/search?q=camera+calibration+pattern&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwi56NbFsqTpAhWO1uAKHXlVAIAQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=camera+calibration+pattern&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyBggAEAgQHjIGCAAQCBAeMgQIABAYOgQIIxAnOgQIABBDUMIyWMdTYP5UaAJwAHgAgAFbiAGuEJIBAjI4mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWc&sclient=img&ei=nGG1XrmqPI6tgwf5qoGACA&bih=951&biw=1853&client=ubuntu&hs=qxl&hl=en) for calibrating your camera at home.\n",

    "2. Then, we will have to **detect the corners** (e.g. using the Harris corner detector) of all images. Fortunately, OpenCV defines a optimized method [cv2.findChessboardCorners()](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html#ga93efa9b0aa890de240ca32b11253dd4a), which automatically detects the corners of the pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. These corners will **have to be matched with the pixels coordinates without perspective** for calculating the homographies (remember when you matched the points of the football field to the corners of a rectangle?). As an example, if we detect the second corner of the third column in the pattern, we will have to match the pixel detected by `cv2.findChessboardCorners()` with a multiple of $(1,2)$. \n",
