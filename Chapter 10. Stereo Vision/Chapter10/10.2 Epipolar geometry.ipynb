    "\n",
    "Epipolar geometry is the **set of geometric constraints between two views of a scene**. When two cameras capture a 3D scene from two different positions, there are a number of geometric relations between the 3D points and their projections onto the 2D images that lead to constraints between the image points. These relations are derived based on the assumption that the cameras can be approximated by the pinhole camera model (e.g. their images are undistorted). $\\\\[10pt]$\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, as we depicted in the previous notebook, accurate triangulation is not fully feasible as **stereo systems does not fulfill the ideal configuration**, but the good news is that any two images taken with any configuration (as long as there is overlap between the images, of course) can be transformed so that they comply with an ideal stereo camera configuration. This is called **stereo rectification** or **image rectification**. Here, we apply homographies to the left and right images in order to force this ideal configuration.$\\\\[10pt]$\n",

    "## 10.2.1 Concepts of epipolar geometry <span id=\"1021\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting to explain how epipolar geometry works, we have to understand some basic concepts: the **epipolar plane**, the **epipolar lines** and the **epipoles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we have the **epipolar plane**. This plane is formed by 3 points: the left and right optical centers ($C_l,\\ C_r$), and a 3D point in the world ($\\mathbf{X}$). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/epipolar1.png\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The interesting thing about the epipolar plane, is that it **intersects the images at the conjugate epipolar lines** of the stereo vision system. The 2D projections $(x_l, x_r)$ of the 3D point $\\mathbf{X}$ are contained also in the epipolar plane and **lie on their corresponding epipolar lines**. As can be seen in the image, these epipolar lines are the **intersection of the epipolar plane and the image planes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might realize, it would be interesting to compute these epipolar lines because they will help us to check **whether a pair of corresponding points is correct or not** (in order to find the matching point in the other image, you don't need to search the whole image, just to search along the epipolar line!). This is called the **epipolar constraint** useful to transform a search in 2D into a 1D problem. Interestingly, this is valid for all the pixels in the images, that is, all the pixels will have their corresponding epipolar line (or **epiline**, for short) in the other image. And even more interestingly, the direction of the epipiles **do not depend on the scene** but only on the camera configuration! That is, if you have a rigid stereo camera pair, the epilines will not change regardless the scene you are viewing! So:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given a two-camera configuration (represented by $R,t$), for each 3D point there is a **unique epipolar plane** and, consequently, a **unique pair of epipolar lines**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, maybe you have noticed that all the epipolar lines **intersect in one single point at each image**, this point is called the **epipole**, and represents the projection of the optical center of each camera on the other image plane (note that it may be outside the boundaries of the image!). All the epilines pass through its epipole. So, one way to determine the position of the epipole is to compute a set of epilines and to find their intersection point.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/epipoles.png\" width=\"450\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some special cases where one or both epipoles **are placed at the infinity** (if the image plane is parallel to the line $C_l-C_r$), which implies that we do not know their location but their *direction*:\n",

OpenCV already implements a method for computing the Fundamental matrix ([`cv2.findFundamentalMat()`](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html#gae420abc34eaa03d0c6a67359609d8429)) from two lists of matching points (unfortunately using their coordinates, not `cv2.keyPoint()` objects). Apart from the Fundamental matrix, this method also returns a vector `mask`, which states the points used for the matrix calculation. Play with the `ransacReprojThreshold` parameter in such function (take a look at it in the OpenCV documentation) and check how many matches are considered inliers depending on it. The expected output is obtained with `ransacReprojThreshold=0.9`."
